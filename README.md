# PaintFlow

PaintFlow is a simple and playful image editing application, drawing inspiration from [Chicory: A Colorful Tale](https://chicorygame.com/). Like the gameâ€™s world where users paint their surroundings, PaintFlow gives users a sandbox to manage, transform and experiment with images.

Through structured data management (using stacks, queues and lists), PaintFlow makes it simple to undo and redo actions, apply transformations and add layers of color and effects, all optimized for smooth performance.
